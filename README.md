# Riru - HookManagedProfile

A module that hook isManagedProfile() in ``android.os.UserManagaer`` to throw restrictions in Android For Business (aka Android For Work) into void.

## Capability

Tested **ONLY** on AOSP like ROM (like OxygenOS). Other ROMs may also work but not permitted. 

**Always do backup before flashing this module, otherwise your phone may be trapped in bootloops.**

## Side effect

Not known for now. I will post some of them when it is discovered. :)
